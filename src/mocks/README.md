# About

[Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/docs/) is an API mocking library that uses Service Worker API to intercept actual requests.

By bringing the ability of Service Workers to capture requests for the purpose of caching, Mock Service Worker enables API mocking on the highest level of the network communication chain. It is the closest thing to a mocking server without having to create one.
